Instruction:
You are to develop a Testimonial section. Just try your best to design as close to the 
sample as possible. Use any random profile image of your choice. Ask questions too when in doubt.
Lorem text:
Magnam dolores commodi suscipit. Necessitatibus eius consequatur ex aliquid fuga eum quidem. 
Sit sint consectetur velit. Quisquam quos quisquam cupiditate. Et nemo qui impedit suscipit alias ea. 
Quia fugiat sit in iste officiis commodi quidem hic quas.

(Use any random lorem text of your choice for the profiles.)

Development:
Design both the mobile and desktop views so it can be responsive on phone.
 
Note: The sample project is a property of Bootstrap 5 so I have no official right to it. It
is only used for learning purpose.
